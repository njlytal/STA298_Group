# ****** OTHER GROUP PROJECTS ******

# *** Sleep Group ***
# Use multilevel modeling (within & between subjects)

# Relationship between hunger and sleep efficiency
# (% time in bed asleep)
# Which other characteristics of individuals matter?
# Of the 30k or so, only 361 answered the "hunger" scale
# question (hunger from 0 to 3)
# These 361 make up the set used in this study
# NOTE: Most people answered 0, may affect results

# *** IAMSTEM ***

# Predicting Student Retention
# 1st quarter performance vs end result
# Other data such as high school SATs, flags for
# 1st gen in family going to college, low-income family,
# using counseling or not, etc.
# % of students starting in STEM that do/don't get their degree in STEM

# *** LEAF VEIN TRACING ***
# Leaf structure affects ability to retain water and withstand drought
# How to crossbreed domestic & wild tomatoes to get
# drought resistant plants that are still edible?
# Strong conditions: very homogeneous growth
# 
# Tracing leaves is very tricky: similar objects
# like chloroplasts may fool machines, and line thickness
# can vary--not all veins are detected each time
# Some leaves unreadable due to rips and tears

# Looking at veins as topological invariants (graphs)
# Math properties like loops and mid/secondard/tertiary veins
# Limitations: pictures don't show entire leaf

# *** KEYBOARD OPTIMIZATION ***
# Qwerty not designed for touch screens: non-optimal
# key frequency distribution. Lots of common letters are
# clumped together, while less common ones are on edges
# Frequency as first and second letters changes drastically
# Goal: Improve keyboard layout, improve autocorrect, etc.
# Focus on top 10% most common words, which comprise, for instance,
# 80% of the words in "Huck Finn"
# Generate random input vectors for various words, see if
# autocorrect would work or not
# Monte Carlo approach to data: generate random word & input vector,
# then pick out most likely words & see if they match
# Uses neural networks & SVM
# Repeat n times to determine probability of success
# Swap letters and replace keyboards if higher efficiency results
